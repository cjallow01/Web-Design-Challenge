Deployed Github linl: https://github.com/cjallow01/Web-Design-Challenge

In this assignment I used HTML and CSS to create a dashboard featuring the Latitude vs. X analysis of weather. Note that thing assignment is displaying results from prior analysis done in python-api-challenge through Github pages using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

Instructions

Create a website by using either the visualizations that was created for the Python-APIs Challenge or the weather data and images that are provided for this Challenge. To do so, use the considerations and website requirements that the following subsections describe. 

A landing page that contains the following elements:
1. An explanation of the project.
2. A link to each visualization page. For these, a sidebar should contain a preview image of each visualization. Clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.
